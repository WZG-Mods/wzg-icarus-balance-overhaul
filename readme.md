This is a mod we made to play with friends. Main changes: removed as much grind as possible for T3 and T4, and made workshop items much more rewarding to get. Feel free to try it out and give your feedback.

DISCLAIMER: This mod is for the casual players with limited time, and definitely not for the hardcore survival players. If there will be significant interest to this mode in the community, we consider making a “hardcore” version of it as well. 

We are a team of three prospectors: a miner, a hunter and a cook/gardener. The rest of the responsibilities we share. We all have real-life jobs, responsibilities and time limits. We cannot grind endlessly to get to T4, it is just not fun if you don’t have all the time in the world.

We are trying to remove the issues and make the game fun and more friendly to casual players in this mod. Here the general way of thinking that we were following:

- Most items in the workshop should have a reason to buy and use in the missions. We have buffed and changed the perks on many of them.
- Many items that were not worth it to craft got buffed.
- Players should spend much more time exploring and crafting rather than grinding ores in the caves.
- The game should be fun for a casual player.

Following are the highlights of the changes that we introduced. For the full list of changes please look at the Git repository. There you can see all the changes made to the original config files.

- Durability of the workshop tools is much higher.
- Most of the recipes of tiers 3 and 4 are now cheaper, to remove the frustrating grind and make progression more smooth. Removed “the grind wall” between T3 and T4.
- Many regular items got buffed so that it makes sense to craft and use them. For example, Polar Bear armor required to kill anywhere from 15 (crazy luck) to around 30, and spend a talent point on top of it. It would give just small buffs in comparison to the Fur Armor. Basically, useless. We changed it to provide +20% cold resistance, threat modifier -25%, and +15% movement speed in the Arctic biome. I.e. it makes you warm, stealthy and very fast in the Arctic. That is something worth considering now.
- Crossbow bolts are more expensive and give a much stronger punch.
- Thermoses are now buffed and have longer effects.
- Plants grown in the plots provide as many resources as when collected with a sickle (stone sickle) in the wild.
- Spoiling time of all food types changed so that food never spoils before it's buff expires.
- Torches are much cheaper.
- All Armor Sets where fully rebalanced to provide significant advantages for specific purposes.

- Ice box and fridge spoil rate 10X slower.
- Spears deal much more damage.
